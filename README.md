# TakeSnapShotsAndMail

Let Homey trigger your IP Cam take snapshots and send a zip with the taken snapshots to your E-mail address.
Works great with door sensors or ir sensors. You can keep an eye on your possessions, when you're not around.

Tested with a Foscam camera, but also other cams might work.
